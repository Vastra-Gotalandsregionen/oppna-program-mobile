# Mobile Overview #
The mobile portal is comprised by the following set of Liferay plugins:

  * Mobile Icon Portlet, which is an instantiable portlet with settings for name, icon image, url to the application (widget) and counter service.
  * [Mobile Theme](MobileThemeOverview.md), which contains the customization of the look and feel for the pages where the theme is used
  * Mobile Layouttpl, which contains the layout template (grid system) used for each dashboard page

## App-icon look and feel ##

The mobile portal consists of a number of dashboard pages with application icons:

When the user clicks (or taps) an icon, the application is launched in an overlay on the page:
